# Instructions to train SmolLM3-3B

We are open-sourcing all the artifacts to train [SmolLM3-3B](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B). You can find the configuration files for the three post-training stages in the [`sft`](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/tree/main/recipes/smollm3/sft) and [`dpo`](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/tree/main/recipes/smollm3/dpo) directories. 

We are currently working on the code release, so this README will contain the instructions to run training after we release the code on the week of July 14, 2025.
